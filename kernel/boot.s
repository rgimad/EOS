# Declare a multiboot header that marks the program as a kernel.  These
# are magic values that are documented in the multiboot standard.  The
# bootloader will search for this signature in the first 8KiB of the 
# kernel file, aligned at a 32-bit boundary.  The signature is in its
# own section so the header can be forced to be in the first 8 KiB of 
# the kernel file.

# The multiboot standard does not define the value of the stack pointer
# register esp, and it's up to the kernel to provide a stack.  The following
# lines allocate room for a small stack by creating a symbol at the bottom,
# then allocating 16KiB for it, then putting a symbol at the top.  The
# stack will grow downwards.  It's apparently in its own section so it
# can be marked nobits, but there doesn't seem to actually be anything
# that does that.  Odd.  In theory doing that allows us to avoid having
# 16KiB of dead bytes in the binary.
# The stack needs to be 16-byte alsigned for x86 according to the System
# V ABI standard, so we do that here.

# Reserve a stack for the initial thread.
